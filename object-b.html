    <h1> Object B: Blue Mug</h1>
    <p>My second object is a Blue mug. From the Comc store when I go there I go to the 
    Dollarama right after. Mainly because at the dollar store I can find a lot of cheap 
    things to experiment with and occupy my time. </p>
    
    <p>This Mug is important because this is where my business started and how I came
    to make the decision to study Graphic Design at Niagara College. What happened
    was is that I was at home and it had been 4 months since I had left my house 
    other then to do grocery shopping so I was a little stir crazy. I went to the dollar 
    the Canadian tire and I saw an engraving pen and thought that I should mess 
    around with it. </p>
    
    <p>I went to the Dollarama and got a bunch of glasses and mugs (including this one)
    I started carving on them and my cousin saw them and asked me if I could engrave 
    his logo on them and so I did. After setting up an Ets shop and doing a few 
    commissions I thought I should look into studying graphic design and 
    learn to expand my business. One Blue mug set me on a whole new 
    path.
