    <h1>Object A: Comic book </h1>

   <p> My First object is a comic book. This is my first becuase for one I HATE walking 
    and so I will avoid it at all costs. Secondly I lived in Toronto before I moved to
    Niagara so needless to say if I wanted to go somewhere it was fairly easy.</p>
    
    <p>I say all this because I walked for an hour or more just to go to the Big B comic
    store so I could do something I enjoy. Comics are important to me because
    in a time where I was trying to adjust to a new place, while keeping my sanity 
    during this pandemic the comic store gave me something I could look forward
    to and occupy my time with. It gave me a reason to leave my house.
